# SecLib
SecLib is a simple header-only library that checks all running processes for certain identifiers.

There is still much room for improvement. Initially, it was a project aimed at securing one of my software programs. However, I decided against using SecLib to secure the software, so I thought why not release it instead. At the time of release, the project was still in mid-development and therefore not yet finished.
