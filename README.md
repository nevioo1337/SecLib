# SecLib
SecLib is a simple header-only library that checks all running processes for certain identifiers.

There is still much room for improvement. Initially, it was a project aimed at securing one of my software programs. However, I decided against using SecLib to secure the software, so I thought why not release it instead. At the time of release, the project was still in mid-development and therefore not yet finished.

## Todo
- Implement wildcard support for the signature scanner to increase its flexibility and usability.
- Enhance module enumeration to provide a more comprehensive list of loaded modules in the system.
- Develop a kernel driver for improved system-level access and control.
- Implement integrity checks to ensure that system files and configurations have not been tampered with or modified.
- Implement file hash checks to detect any unauthorized changes to critical system files.
- Improve grammar and sentence structure throughout the project documentation and code comments.
